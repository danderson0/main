Problem \#1a *Go Git 'em!* 
=======================

**NAME**:

Outcomes 
--------

-   Create arrays in MATLAB
-   Manipulate arrays in MATLAB
-   Push updates up to the Github site

Problem 
-------

From now on, we need to share files in a way that allows the most
up-to-date versions are accessible to all concerned parties. I have gone
through *some* the highlights and features of *GitHub*, and I hope that you
see the benefit of such a system. All assignments will be "turned in"
using this system. (Really, all you have to do is keep your code files
in the folders that correspond to the appropriate repository on *GitHub*).
Now let's update the script file `prob1.m`. 

1.  Create a copy of `prob1.m` and call it `satellite.m`
1.  Modify the program so that it also calculates and prints the
        velocity *v* of the satellite at a particular *h*.
1. Round off the orbital altitude and velocity before printing them.
1. What happens when you set `T = [90 100 110 120 130]`? (*You should encounter an error*)
1. Modify the program so that it can accept an array for `T`
1. Time permitting, be imaginative and add any other flourishs to the program.
1. Finally, push these modified files up to your *p1* GitHub repository and
    check `github.com/Phys1211` to ensure that you were successful
