# Knowledge

## MATLAB
1. Relational statements in index to filter data
2. Thinking patterns often come to match the language structure
3. Use .mlx file to debug code, keeps record
4. `for` loops are not very common, MATLAB is designed act on arrays
5. import/export excel files
6. love/hate datatypes. Many more than python, but some are useful.
7. Don't overcomplicate things. Computers do do what you say.
8. 'plot' function is multifaced with `figure()`, `hold on` and `hold off`
9. Using comments to debug code - knock some parts out for a bit
10. right click on a function to get to documentation - MATLAB documentation is good
11. The use of command line and workspace is actually helpful
12. Use variables and not values for commonly used parameters
13. `help` is another way to documentation
14. Double down on **simplicity**
