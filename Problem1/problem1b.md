Problem

 After learning about plotting in MATLAB, we are, again, improving upon the program called satellite.m. Currently, satellite should ask for a period in seconds and print out the altitude (in km) and velocity (in km/s). We want to make adjustments and add in some functionality

1. Make the appropriate changes so that the user can input a period in hours not seconds.
1. Add code that produces a graph of altitude (in km) vs orbital period (in hours). The range of values for the plot should be between 1/5 the value of the smallest inputted period to 5x the largest inputted period. For example, I could input `2` (hours), the plot should graph from a period of 2/5 of an hour to 10 hours. Graph a blue triangle at the input period(s) position on the plot
1. Add code that produces a graph of velocity (in km/s) vs altitude (in km). Again the range of values for the plot should correspond to 1/5 the value of the smallest inputted period to 5x the largest inputted period. Graph a blue triangle at the point corresponding to the input period(s) on the plot.
1. *Add code that gives a visual representation of the satellite relative to Earth and the International Space Station's orbit. Yes, this is vague. I'm not telling you how to do it. Be inventive. Refer to the sites below.*
1. Don't forget to push up your progress to the `p1-<username>` repository on GitHub.
